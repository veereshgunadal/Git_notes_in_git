Local directory(save file ctrl+s)               Local git repo(add, commit command)            github git repo(git push command)

github git repo(ui page click commit changes)   Local git repo(git fetch maybe updated github to Local git repo not directory)  directory(git pull updated)  
                                                      (aftet fetch git status is Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 2 commits
                                                       , and can be fast-forwarded.(use "git pull" to update your local branch)




1st Flow (Creating repo in GitHub and use in local)

1. create new repo
2. clone to Local directory
3. make changes in local directory
4. run add command
5. run commit command ( staging area or local git repo stage)
6. run git push origin main


2nd Flow (Creating repo in Local and use in local)

1. create Local directory
2. run git init command
3. create new repo and copy link
4. run git remote add origin "copy link"
5. run git branch -M "rename branch"     (default master)
6. make changes in local directory
7. run add command
8. run commit command (staging area or local git repo stage)
9. run git push origin main

can do 2nd Flow by step number like these 1,2, 6,7,8, 3,4,5, 9

3rd Flow (Taking full repo from GitHub)

1. run git clone command
2. make changes in local directory
3. run add command
4. run commit command
5. run git push origin main command

4th Flow (Ongoing project make new branch and mering in main branch)

1. git branch -b "branch name"
2. make changes in local directory
3. run add command
4. run commit command
5. run git push origin "branch name" command  (this made changes in that branch only not in main branch)
6. run git merge main command ( or GitHub ui page raise pull requests)

5th Flow (Ongoing project taking main branch after merging other branch)

1. run git fetch command (updated the staging area or local git repo stage)
2. run git pull command
